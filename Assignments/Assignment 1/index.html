      <h2>I am enrolled in the Digital Media and Design ALM program</h2>
      <ul>
        The courses I have completed in the program, beginning in Spring 2021,
        include:
        <li>CSCI 7 Intro to Computer Sci/Python</li>
        <li>DGMD 2 Web Programming/PHP</li>
        <li>CSCI 12 Website Development</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This course will complete the requirements for the degree. I would love
        to successfully complete it this term! I would love to be able to use
        these skills to take over the design and deployment of the website for
        <a href="https://www.belmontporchfest.org/" target="_blank"
          >Belmont Porchfest</a
        >
        <br />
        Additionally, I'd like to build a website to showcase archival materials
        along with digital media story telling to engage audiences.
